# Image Colorization Model using GAN
This repository contains the code for an image colorization model based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The model takes grayscale images as input and generates corresponding colorized versions.

Overview <br />
The model consists of two main components: <br />

Generator: Converts grayscale images to colorized versions. <br />
Discriminator: Distinguishes between real colorized images and those generated by the generator. <br />
Dataset: <br />
The model is trained on the ColTran dataset, containing grayscale and corresponding color images. The dataset is split into training and testing sets. <br />

Model Architecture <br />
Generator: The generator model consists of convolutional layers followed by transpose convolutional layers for upsampling.  <br />
Discriminator: The discriminator model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify real and generated images.  <br />
Training <br />
The models are trained using TensorFlow. The training process involves adversarial training, where the generator and discriminator are trained iteratively to improve performance.  <br />

Evaluation  <br />
The trained model is evaluated on the testing dataset using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and visual inspection of colorized images compared to ground truth. <br />

Dependencies <br />
Python 3.x   <br />
TensorFlow   <br />
NumPy        <br />
scikit-learn  <br />
PIL (Python Imaging Library) <br />

Results<br />
Sample colorized images and evaluation metrics are provided in the repository. <br />
